# ENPM662-Robot-Modeling
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic journey in ENPM662 during the Fall of 2022. It encompasses solutions and code submissions for all projects, providing dedicated folders for each project, along with accompanying documentation and resources.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview
The Robot Modeling course provides a foundational understanding of robot modeling principles, covering forward and inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, Jacobians, dynamics, planning, and contact. While the primary focus is on serial open-chain robots, the curriculum also touches on parallel robots, closed-chain systems, aerial and mobile robots, hyper-redundant systems, and grasping.
