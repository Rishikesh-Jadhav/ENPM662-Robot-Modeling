# ENPM662-Robot-Modeling
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic journey in ENPM662 during the Fall of 2022. It encompasses solutions and code submissions for all projects, providing dedicated folders for each project, along with accompanying documentation and resources.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview
The Robot Modeling course explores planning techniques essential for realizing autonomous robots. Covering task planning, motion planning, and trajectory planning, the curriculum emphasizes traditional motion planning techniques with a focus on integrating physics into the planning process. Mobile robots are used as examples throughout the course, and the techniques introduced are equally applicable to robot manipulators.
