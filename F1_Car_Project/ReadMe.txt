2.Move the folder into the src folder of the catkin workspace of your system. 

3.Build the package by using the command - catkin_make clean && catkin_make (Donâ€™t  forget  to     source before you build your package). 

4.Launch the car in Gazebo using the command - roslaunch updated_assembly             updated_assembly.launch.

5.In a parallel terminal open rviz to visualize the robot.(don't forget to start simulation in     gazebo before visualizing in Rviz.)

6.In another terminal open the teleop file using the command- python3 teleop_template.py.
  to control the car in Gazebo.
 
7.The above instructions will help you move the robot manually in Gazebo and visualize in Rviz.
 
8.Now to run the publisher_subscriber, open 4 terminals(1 for roscore,1 for lauching the robot     in Gazebo ,1 for publisher,1 for subscriber ) 

9.Note that to run the publisher and subscriber file to make the robot go round in a circle in     an empty world, comment out the competion arena line in the launch file.  

10.After completing the steps above in the given order, the car should go round in circles in     the empty world in Gazebo.
